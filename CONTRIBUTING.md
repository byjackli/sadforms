# Contributing to Sad Forms
updated on: March 17, 2022

Sad Forms is a form component designed around Svelte. The most important aspects of Sad Forms is accessibility, ease-of-use, and front-end user satisfaction across all major platforms and devices. To further this goal, Sad Forms also has a form builder tool for developers.

This repository contains code for both the form component and the form builder tool. To prevent confusion, the term "Sad Forms" always refers to the form component, and references to the form builder tool will be explicitly stated.

I am unsure how much traction this project will gain, so I will be reallocating my time to other areas of the project, and in general, other projects. If you're interested in contributing, please contact me on twitter [@byjackli](https://twitter.com/byjackli).

## Pull Request
Firstly, thank you for taking the time and effort of contributing! Although it may not always go through, I will do my best to review and communicate feedback to you! Always fork the repository from `main`. All changes, whether to Sad Forms or the form builder, are expected to go through the [develop branch](https://github.com/byjackli/sadforms/tree/develop). If you made updates to both Sad Forms and the form builder tool, make sure you separate both contributions into two separate pull requests.
