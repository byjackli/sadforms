<!-- 
    
    
    list should actually be the same component as dropdown

    the key differences being:
    1. dropdown is always activated
    2. no checkbox/radios
    3. "other" settings are always {
        add: true,
        remove: true,
        limit: undefined,
    }

    will this make the dropdown component too heavy?
