## About

Three quarter‚Äôs into first release, I discovered there already exists a plethora of Svelte form solutions. Oops. We‚Äôll just call it reinventing the wheel or understanding/appreciating the wheel on a deeper level, whatever floats yer boat. 

Sad Forms is a byproduct of another, much larger, passion project. 

I‚Äôve forgotten the initial solution Sad Forms was designed to solve, but accessibility is top priority! I am aware areas of the form can be improved, such as printable character navigation for dropdown/selects or live file previews, and I‚Äôm doing my best to deliver (because I also need it for my main passion project). 

See the [roadmap](https://sadforms.com/docs/roadmap) for list of upcoming features and the version logs.

## Form Builder

Unless you‚Äôre somehow dynamically creating sign-up/log-in forms on the fly, feel free to utilize the online [form builder tool](https://sadforms.com) to quickly create static forms. Diagnose and view changes live in the browser.

The form builder tool is rich with debug mode and type-check-free function previewing.

See the [roadmap](https://sadforms.com/docs/roadmap) for list of upcoming features.
